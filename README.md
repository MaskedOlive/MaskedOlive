## Hi thereðŸ‘‹
Mechanical Engineer by degree intereted in all things within the intelligence areas. This can be from gatehring intelligence, cybersecurity, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), GEO/HUM/SIGINT Areas, digital forensics and more.

This acts as a collection of research, tried and tested sources, tools and other learning materials that have been explored within these fields. There is no goal with this but to be useful and store the information I have learned in a structured way.

## Areas of Interest
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):** Tools and methods for gathering anf analysing public available data.
- **HUMINT / GEOINT / SIGINT:** Looking into Satellite imagery, geolocation, publically available signals intelligence and radio frequency analysis.
- **Cybersecurity & CEH:** Pen testing, threat intel and vulnerability.
- **Malware Analysis:** Static and dynamic analysis techniques to understand how it operates.
- **Counter-Surveillance & OPSEC:** Anonymity techniques, digital footprint minimisation, and anti-OSINT techniques.
- **Digital Forensics:** Investigating forensic techniques for analysing systems, memory, and network traffic.

## Projects and Repositories
Several repositories to cover the above areas in more detail. Will be updated slows over the coming months.
